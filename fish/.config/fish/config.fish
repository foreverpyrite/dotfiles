# Add Cargo's bin directory to the path

# --- Appearance ---
# While the GitHub says to use `fish theme save`, I think it's either
# outdated or slightly incorrect. 
fish_config theme choose "Catppuccin Mocha"
# I also want to either swap some of the Catppuccin colors around,
# or break the Catppuccin theme for my shell since it makes the most
# sense to be the most personalized.
# What I normally do is a lot of cyan and purple though, which isn't
# the most appealing.
# Perhaps when I get to that I'll customize Starship a little more too...

# --- Forcing Tmux Upon Thyself ---
# I keep doing all these things with tmux and looking at tpm plugins,
# yet for some reason I'm not always using it
#
# Should only activate in a terminal emulator though, since it starting
# with the env of the tty or neovim instead of the wayland session is 
# really annoying tbh

# This sucks, I'll figure something out
# if not tty | string match --quiet --regex '^/dev/tty[0-9]+$' and not set -q NVIM
#     # Making it a varible just in case I wanna change it some day
#     set DEFAULT_SESSION home
#     if status is-interactive && not set -q TMUX
#         tmux attach -t $DEFAULT_SESSION || tmux new-session -s $DEFAULT_SESSION
#     end
# end
